This is still, very much, a work in progress. The goal of this project is to hold simple (Physics 101) equations, but also more detailed work (n-dimensional physics, integration approximations, etc.). Expect most work to come incrementally, starting from the more simple topics to the more advanced.

Please reach out if something is off or there is any confusion
